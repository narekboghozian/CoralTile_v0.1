# Coral Tile v0.1

Prototype 1

## Design Comprimises

The design of the prototype differs from that of the final design in several ways:

### No power optomization
* No / minimal switching converter use
* No power calculations, just a larger battery
* Significant power losses from LDO use
### No custom display
* LCD elements will be glued to inside of thick plate of glass
### Use of prebuilt modules
* Micro Controller
* Wireless RX
* Battery PMIC
### UI Limitations
* Minimal WiFi UI
* Charge interruptions can kill wifi
### Form Factor
* Emergency debug ports sealed off with removable seal
### Code
* Un-optimized, will consume too much power
* Will lack complete functionality



## Experimentation

### GPS
* Experimentation with GPS to determine viability
### Display
* Display construction method may be viable alternative to custom lcd
### WiFi
* Field test for viability of WiFi
